# samples
A collection of miscellaneous code I've written over the years for class, research, and personal use cases.

NLPresearch contains a proof-of-concept Log-Linear Model classifier, and some of my work at the JHU CLSP; particularly in implementing the
Nicolai et al. (2015) system for morphological generation. The team I worked with was instrumental in creating the datasets for the
SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task â€” Morphological Reinflection, and this implementation was used in evaluating the quality of those datasets
against the results reported in Nicolai et al. (2015) using the dataset from Greg Durrett and John DeNero (2013).

Cryptology contains, as the name suggests, various functions related to cryptology. The ones in the matlab sub-folder were for class
assignments, while the ones in the python sub-folder are for personal edification.

Bedtime contains 2 scripts I wrote one day to automate a part of my bedtime routine: put the computer on a countdown to sleepmode, open a
chrome window to play some relaxing sounds, and dim the brightness. In the process of writing these two scripts, I learned new things
about chrome, elevating to admin in Windows, and display controls.
