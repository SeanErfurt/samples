This folder contains some Java files I wrote for my Data Structures class.

JHUHashMap is an interface specifying a hash map, given in class.
MyJHUHashMap is the implementation of that interface.

DomainTally is a program which extracts and counts occurrences of domains
in a file like urls.txt. When it encounters the string "report" in the
file, it outputs the current most common domain name. Uses a Maximum
Priority Queue based on the Sedgewick implementation for keeping track of
the most common domain name.
urls.txt is the sample input for this program.
